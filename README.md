# Blu — Behavioral Analytics & Action Platform

> **Track → Understand → Decide → Act**  
> Blu is a B2B SaaS platform that helps companies turn user behavior into business actions — all in one multi‑tenant system.

---


> [!WARNING]
>This project is **not yet production‑ready**, but the core infrastructure is taking shape.  
> **Status: Development deferred**

We’re building a complete data‑to‑action pipeline that combines:
- Analytics (mixpanel‑like)  
- Feature flags (launchdarkly‑like)  
- Actions & integrations (hightouch‑like)  

**Why you should star this repo** → Because this is the only open‑source platform that does all three in one, with a behavioral engine that auto‑enables features based on user activity.

## 🎯 The Goals

### For the Product
- **Multi‑tenant SaaS** – each customer gets isolated data and subdomains
- **Event ingestion** – SDKs for web, mobile, and backend
- **Analytics core** – dashboards, funnels, cohorts, and custom reports
- **Segmentation engine** – dynamic user grouping based on behavior
- **Rule engine** – customer‑defined logic (if‑this‑then‑that for analytics)
- **Action adapters** – feature flags, Slack, webhooks, email
- **Behavioral auto‑flags** – enable features automatically when users hit criteria

### For Developers (this project)
- **Clean architecture** – separation of ingestion, processing, storage, analytics, and actions
- **Async‑first** – all heavy work goes through JetQueue
- **Demo‑mode ready** – can run fully on Vercel’s free tier with mock data
- **SDK‑first** – a stable, versioned SDK for customers
- **Open‑source core** – MIT license, community‑driven
